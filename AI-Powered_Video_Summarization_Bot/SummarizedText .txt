Centre allows users to choose from pre-existing machine learning models or deploy their own, built by a team of data scientists. It offers over 20 out-of-the-box models and can be used across various industries with its drag-and-drop interface, making it accessible even for non-data scientists. The platform is deployable in the cloud or on-premises. It includes features like data labeling, machine learning workflows, model evaluation, and live deployment of machine learning skills. The video also discusses its integration with UiPath Studio for automating tasks such as classifying customer complaints via email. Additionally, human input is incorporated when model confidence is low, allowing for retraining to improve performance.
